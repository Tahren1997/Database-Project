# Database-Project

Hello, dear reviewer
Thanks for reading the file before the reviewing


To save your time understanding the project file
Here are some clue to follow :


1. To confirm database creation, please review the ER diagram and the mySQL file included in the "DB Create" directory

2. For procedure creation review, I create x3 "create_procedure" file for the task, please feel free to test each of them. Here are some tips for where the procedure is created :
>>  GetMaxQuantity() -> create_procedure_1.sql
>>  ManageBooking() ->
>>  UpdateBooking() -> create_procedure_3.sql
>>  AddBooking() -> create_procedure_3.sql
>>  CancelBooking() -> create_procedure_3.sql

3. For Tableau analysis review, please check the pictures or review the Tableau file in the "Tableau" directory

4. The "Python" directory is only for some memory refreshing on python/mySQL connection , please review the "db_connect.py" for the project review


Thank you for taking you time reviewing my project
Please feel free to comment if you have any recommendation for me on the project

Have a good day :)


Sincerely,
Tyler Chen
